# ChainVote - Decentralized Voting & Polling DApp

## About The Project

**ChainVote** is a decentralized voting and polling application built on blockchain technology, designed such a way to ensure transparency, security, and immutability in the voting process. It eliminates the risks of centralized systems like manipulation, fraud, and lack of transparency by leveraging smart contracts and decentralized networks like ETH.

## Key Features

1. **Decentralized Governance:** Votes are recorded on-chain and the system does not rely on any central admin to manage elections or polls.
2. **Immutable Records:** Once cast, votes cannot be altered or revert back, ensuring trust in election results.
3. **Transparent Process:** Anyone can verify the votes and results through the public blockchain, enhancing credibility.
4. **Secure & Private Voting:** Uses cryptographic techniques to protect voter identity while maintaining vote uprightness.
5. **Smart Contract Automation:** Automates poll creation, voting deadlines, result calculation, and more without human intervention.
6. **Token or Wallet-Based Access:** Voter eligibility can be controlled using wallet address whitelisting or governance tokens.
